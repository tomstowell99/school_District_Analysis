# school_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
  The school board has asked us to review the recent state testing performed in the district. There is a concern that the 9th grade tests at the Thomas High school were 
  tampered with. I will be removing the 9th grade reading and math scores and re-evaluating the districts scores. In an effort to see the impact this dishonesty had on 
  the district.
