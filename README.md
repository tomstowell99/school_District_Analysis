# school_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
  The school board has asked us to review the recent state testing performed in the district. There is a concern that the 9th grade tests at the Thomas High school were 
  tampered with. I will be removing the 9th grade reading and math scores and re-evaluating the districts scores. In an effort to see the impact this dishonesty had on 
  the district.
  
  ## Results
  
  * District Summary
    At the distric level. Our passing rates were only marginally impacted lower, as you can see on the charts below. One grade from our 15 schools did not have the 
    significant impact on our overal averages and pass rates.

     * School Summary 
        By removing the ninth grade class from Thomas High school it did lower the overall math and reading averages for the high school. This also in turn lowered the 
        math, reading and overall passing rate. Thomas High School however did maintain their posisiton as the second highest ranking school in terms of overall pass
        rate.
