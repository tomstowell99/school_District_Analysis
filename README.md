# school_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
  The school board has asked us to review the recent state testing performed in the district. There is a concern that the 9th grade tests at the Thomas High school were 
  tampered with. I will be removing the 9th grade reading and math scores and re-evaluating the districts scores. In an effort to see the impact this dishonesty had on 
  the district.
  
  ## Results
  
  * District Summary
    At the distric level. Our passing rates were only marginally impacted lower, as you can see on the charts below. One grade from our 15 schools did not have the 
    significant impact on our overal averages and pass rates.

     * School Summary 
        By removing the ninth grade class from Thomas High school it did lower the overall math and reading averages for the high school. This also in turn lowered the 
        math, reading and overall passing rate. Thomas High School however did maintain their posisiton as the second highest ranking school in terms of overall pass
        rate.

        * Math and reading scores by grade
          The only change here is that for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. Their grades are now replaced with Nan.
           This has the affect of not including the averages for the school for the district as a whole.

        * Scores by school spending
          Spending per student was not impacted very much by the exclusion of the 9th grade data. In addition there is generally a negative corellation
          between the per student spending and the testing outcome. 
               
          Scores before changes:

        * Scores by school size
          Small and medium size schools have average math and reading scores that are very similiar. They also have similiar overall passing rates.
          Large schools have a much lower average math score and a slightly lower reading score. Large schools have a significantly lower overall passing 
          score.

        * Scores by school type
          Charter type has an impact on the success rates in both math and reading. If you attend a charter school you are much more likely to pass the math or 
          reading test. you are 90% likely to pass both math and reading if attending a charter school versus only 54% if attending a district school
